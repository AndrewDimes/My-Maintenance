# My Maintenance
My Maintenance is an app I am currently building to help apartments keep track of repairs needed by residents. I hope to provide funcionality to easily allow residents to sign up, create a profile, and create work orders. Once a work order is created an admin or member of the maintenance team can accept the work order changing its status from submitted to open. Upon completion of the work order it will then be changed to complete alerting the resident.
